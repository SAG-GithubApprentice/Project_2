# Tech Stock Performance Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is designed to predict the future performance of tech giants: Intel, Nvidia, and AMD using machine learning (ML). By analyzing historical stock data, we aim to develop a model that can accurately forecast stock prices, providing valuable insights for investors and enthusiasts interested in the technology sector.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to set up your environment first.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip

### Setup

This section describes the structure of the project and how to navigate it.

- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Saved models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `src/`: Source code for the project.
- `visualizations/`: Graphs and plots generated from the data.

## Data Collection

We use historical stock price data for Intel, Nvidia, and AMD, sourced from financial data providers through API requests. The dataset comprises over 1,000 records for each company to ensure comprehensive analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **Matplotlib/Pandas Plotting**: For generating visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **API Requests**: To fetch historical stock data.

## Model Development

The project employs supervised machine learning models to predict stock prices, focusing on techniques suitable for time series data. We explore various models, evaluate their performance, and fine-tune them for optimal results.

## Usage

Instructions on running the project, from data preprocessing, model training, to evaluation, are detailed within the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

## Visualizations

We include visualizations of stock trends, model accuracy, and predictions in the `visualizations/` folder. These charts and graphs are key to understanding the data and the model's performance.
